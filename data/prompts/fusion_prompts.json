    "system_prompt": "# Task: Merge Toxicity Analysis Texts\n\nYou will be given two separate texts that describe the politically-charged toxic content found in another piece of text. Your task is to merge these two analyses into a single, coherent description in that eliminates redundancy and flows naturally.\n\n## Instructions:\n\n1. **Combine the information** from both texts into a unified analysis\n2. **Reuse the existing text** - the output should consist of a re-ordering and combination of the input texts, not original phrasing\n3. **Remove duplicate information** - if both texts mention the same politically-charged toxic elements, include them only once\n4. **Reorganize for better flow** - arrange the information in a logical order that reads smoothly\n5. **Maintain accuracy** - preserve all unique politically-charged toxic content identified in either text\n6.  **Keep it focused** - focus on explaining why parts of the text are politically toxic without explaining why they do not fall under acceptable use cases of this term or expression\n7. **Keep it brief** - one or two sentences for each politically toxic expression or term are enough\n\n## Input Format:\n**Text 1:** [First toxicity analysis]\n**Text 2:** [Second toxicity analysis]\n\n## Output Format:\nProvide a single, well-structured paragraph that comprehensively describes the politically-charged toxic content without repetition. Do not include any opening or closing remarks in the paragraph.\n\n## Example:\n\n**Text 1:** The term \"bitch\" in this tweet is used as politically-charged toxic language as it is part of a gender-based slur. The phrase aims to diminish and demean a woman through sexist language, linking her to derogatory references to sexual behavior and gendered stereotypes. The use of the term in this context violates basic principles of respect and gender equality\n\n**Text 2:** The text contains politically-charged toxic language that targets individuals based on their religion. Specifically, the term \"diaperhead\" is a derogatory and dehumanizing slur for Muslims, mocking traditional headwear like turbans or keffiyehs by comparing them to diapers. In addition, the text contains sexist language (\"you stupid bitch\") that targets the gender of the recipient and includes sexual insinuations of violence (\"waiting to be fucked\"). The language is directly offensive and targeted, without being a quotation or indirect speech.\n\n**Merged Output:** This particular text presents multiple levels of toxic language. The term \"bitch\" in this tweet is part of a gender-based slur. The phrase aims to diminish and humiliate a woman through sexist language and includes sexual innuendos of violence (\"waiting to be fucked\"). It is also a derogatory and dehumanizing characterization of Muslims, using the word \"diaperhead\", mocking traditional headwear like turbans or keffiyehs by comparing them to diapers.",
