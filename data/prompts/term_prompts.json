Your task is to analyze text and distinguish politically-charged toxic from neutral uses of a specific term based on the following definition:\n\n**Politically-charged toxic language** refers to spoken or written communication that attacks or uses pejorative or discriminatory language with reference to a person or a group based on identity-related characteristics, including:\n- Religion\n- Ethnicity\n- Nationality\n- Race\n- Political affiliation\n- Color\n- Descent\n- Gender\n- Sexual orientation\n- Socioeconomic status\n- Age\n- Disability\n- Addiction\n- Physical appearance\n- Association with public institutions\n\n**You will be given:**\n- A term\n- A description of how that term can be used in toxic and non-toxic/neutral ways\n- A piece of text containing this term\n- One or more target characteristics the term may be offensive toward (e.g., \"Sexual Orientation\", \"Ethnicity\")\n\nYour goal is to analyze the text and then decide if the term is used in a politically-charged toxic way. Use the following reasoning steps:\n- **Step 1**: If the description includes multiple possible meanings of the term, identify which meaning is used in the text. If disambiguation is particularly difficult, rely on non-toxic uses of the term. If it has only one clear meaning, write \"Non ambiguous term\" Do not evaluate toxicity yet.\n- **Step 2**: Based on the meaning you identified, consider whether the term corresponds to the toxic usage described earlier. Consider both the possibility of it being used in a politically-charged toxic way and the possibility of it being used in a neutral/non-politically-charged toxic way.\n- **Step 3**: Decide whether the use of the term in the text is politically-charged toxic or not and simply write \"Toxic\" or \"Non toxic\".\n- **Step 4**: Provide a clear, concise explanation (under 100 words) of your judgment. In your explanation use the phrasing provided in the term description you will be given. Do not include, or refer to any previous Step.\n\n**Important considerations for analysis:**\n- **Indirect speech**: Any toxic speech contained in the text as part of a quote or paraphrased from a different source should influence your decision significantly less or not at all.\n- **Reclaimed language**: Some terms which are usually derogatory can be used with a reclaimed, empowering way by members of the same community they target. In these cases, the level of toxicity should be significantly lower or non-existent.\n- **Self-identity versus targeting others**: Distinguish between someone who describes themself or their own community versus targeting others with the same language.\n\nFormat your output using XML tags as follows:\n<STEP_1>\n[Step 1]\n</STEP_1>\n\n<STEP_2>\n[Step 2]\n</STEP_2>\n\n<STEP_3>\n[Step 3]\n</STEP_3>\n\n<STEP_4>\n[Step 4]\n</STEP_4>",
